### **Theoretical Strategy**  

1. **State Representation**:
   - **Team composition**: Current roster, player scores, positions.
   - **Budget**: Available money for transfers.
   - **Market status**: Prices, release clauses, and availability of players.
   - **Competitors**: Other managersâ€™ teams, budgets, and potential targets.
   - **League performance**: Points, position, and remaining fixtures.
   
2. **Actions**:
   - **Buy player**: Purchase from the public market or through a mutual agreement/release clause.
   - **Sell player**: Offer at a discount to other managers or sell to the market.
   - **Adjust release clause**: Change to make players more/less likely to be acquired.
   - **Hold**: No action.

3. **Rewards**:
   - Primary Reward: Points scored by the team after each match.
   - Secondary Rewards:  
     - Budget increase from selling players.
     - Acquiring a player who outperforms the current team average.
     - Avoiding acquisition costs for top-performing players via smart trades.

4. **Cycles**:
   - A cycle is a fixture period. After each match, the agent evaluates:
     - Points gained by the team.
     - Money spent or earned.
     - Team strength after market activity.

### **Reward Definition for Cycles**  

The reward can balance short-term (match-specific) and long-term (seasonal) objectives:  

1. **Points-focused Reward**:
   - Reward = Total Points Scored in the Fixture by the Team.

2. **Budget-conscious Reward**:
   - Reward = \( Points \times \text{Budget Weight} - \text{Money Spent in Cycle} \).  
   - Adjust the **Budget Weight** dynamically based on remaining fixtures to balance budget conservation and competitiveness.

3. **Risk-adjusted Reward**:
   - Reward = \( Points \times (1 + \frac{\text{Budget Remaining}}{\text{Initial Budget}}) - \text{Risk Penalty} \).
   - Penalize actions like overpaying for players who underperform.

4. **Team Value Reward**:
   - Reward = \( Points + \text{Increase in Team Value (e.g., player prices)} \).

### **Implementation Pathway**  

#### **Step 1: Data Collection**
- Gather historical data on player scores, market prices, and league trends.
- Use this to simulate a training environment.

#### **Step 2: Environment Design**
- Create an OpenAI Gym-compatible environment:
  - **State**: Encode current team, market, and league status.
  - **Action Space**: Include buy, sell, adjust clause, and hold actions.
  - **Reward Function**: Implement based on one of the definitions above.

#### **Step 3: RL Model Selection**
- Use model-free RL algorithms like:
  - **DQN (Deep Q-Networks)**: Suitable for discrete action spaces.
  - **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)**: Effective for complex strategies.
  - **DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient)**: If actions include continuous values (e.g., release clause adjustment).

#### **Step 4: Training**
- Simulate seasons to train the agent:
  - Include noise in player performance to mimic real-world unpredictability.
  - Regularly update the market data for realism.

#### **Step 5: Evaluation**
- Evaluate against baseline strategies (e.g., random purchases, top-scorer-only focus).
- Use unseen league data to test generalization.
